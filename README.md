# Todo List Express Framework
Express optimization of former todo list application.

# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, CRUD

By implementing CRUD in this project I was able to create a MongoDB collection to hold each todo list item that can be added, deleted, or tallied.

# Optimizations
I added a "Quote of the Day" API to inspire our little girlies and start the day with some inspiration!

# Lessons Learned:
While creating this project I decided to optimize by adding an additional API outide of my Mongodb. While fetching my data like normal I came acoss the CORS error, which is an abbreviation for "Cross-Origin Response Sharing". This caused my API to fail. I learned that it is a key safety precaution. So if you decide to take a peek at this code, be sure to check out the "Moesif Origin & CORS Changer" browser extension for the development.
